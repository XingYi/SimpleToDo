# Pre-work - *SimpleTodo*

**SimpleTodo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Lim Xing Yi**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [X] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Database includes field "description", "due date", "statue", "date created" for future enhancement
* [X] Shows the date created for each task in the listview

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app.
ListView Position number cannot be solely used just for editing task as it does not correspond to the database auto-incremented
primary id. Hence, need to pass the object id in the Intent to the next Activity screen.

Date Time not displayed correctly, it kept displaying year as 1970. It was fixed by multiplying the UNIX timestamp by 1000.
Eg. String formattedDate = df.format(task.dateCreated * 1000);
